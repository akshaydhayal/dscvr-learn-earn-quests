Live Project Link: [https://web3quests.vercel.app/](https://web3quests.vercel.app/)

## Description

The Web3 learning platform is designed to provide an engaging and interactive experience for users to deepen their knowledge of blockchain technology while earning valuable NFTs. This project revolves around a structured learning system where users complete small quests, each linked to specific subject tracks, and earn a Metaplex Core NFT as proof of work upon completion.

## Features

- **Theory Slides (4-5 Pages):**: Each quest begins with a series of interactive slides that provide theoretical knowledge on the selected topic. The slides are designed to be concise yet informative, breaking down complex concepts into digestible chunks.
- **Quiz Section:**: At the end of the theory slides, users are required to answer two quiz questions to test their knowledge of the material presented. The quiz serves as an assessment to ensure users have grasped the key concepts before proceeding to the NFT reward stage.
- **NFT Minting and Proof of Work**: After attempting the quiz, users are given an opportunity to mint a quest-specific Metaplex Core NFT.
